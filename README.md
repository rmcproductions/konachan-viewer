# Konachan Database Viewer
---
Bored of having all your hardly downloaded konachan images messy on your hard drive? Unsorted, or sorted, but every image fits with multiple tags so you got tons of duplicates?

Stop wasting your diskspace and use this little boi here!

---

### What does work so far?
* Sort & filter images by tags
* Scan a directory for konachan images
* Scanning subdirectories of your special folder.

### What does NOT work?
* Zooming into images (will come as soon as possible).
* Filtering by multiple tags (coming soon).
* Excluding and favorite tags (coming soon).
* The image overview looks shitty as fuck.
